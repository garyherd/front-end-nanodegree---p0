# front-end-nanodegree---p0
write up for developing web developer mindset

Imagine that you are a month into your Nanodegree program and you’re stuck. Totally stuck. You have no idea what’s wrong and you have no idea how to get yourself out of this mess. You’ll write a letter to yourself using what you’ve learned. How will you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you tackle challenges? How will what you’ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?

Dear Gary,

So you're having some trouble with your current assignment?

Keep moving forward.

Best,
Gary


Optional: Consider writing your letter using basic markdown syntax, a key skill that front-end developers use to write readmes.

Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals. Is there a dream job you’re working toward? Is there a project idea you’ve been aching to start working on?
Optional: In addition to your goals, we also want to know about any questions you have about the process of becoming a Front End Developer. Is there anything about being a Front-End Developer that you’d like to know more about?
Your reflection project will be reviewed by our Udacity project reviewers, who are all working developers. They are real humans who have faced the same challenges you will, so they’ll be able to offer up some insights that may help you as you embark on these goals! Make sure to take some time to really think about these reflections. Many of these developers have had the same questions and concerns as you, and they want to hear what you have to say!
