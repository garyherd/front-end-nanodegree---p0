# Project P0 - Developing a Web Developer Mindset

1. Write a letter to your future self using what you’ve learned. How will you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you tackle challenges? How will what you’ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?
2. Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals. Is there a dream job you’re working toward? Is there a project idea you’ve been aching to start working on?

## Letter to Self

Dear Gary,

So you're having some trouble with your current assignment? You knew it wasn't going to be easy. The Udacity people told you it wasn't going to be easy. Remember those articles you read at the beginning of the course? Okay, what to do...

First, get your mind right. Recall the "growth mindset" from Joyce Akiko's "How To Navigate The Up And Downs Of Learning To Code". What can you take away from this challenge so you can get better? Don't worry about how far along, or how much better, other developers are; they had to go through something like this too. There's that great line from the movie Rocky Balboa where he says, "It ain't about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can _get hit_ and keep moving forward.

Next, take a break! Go take a walk, or go listen to some music for 20 minutes. Seeing the problem with fresh eyes might do the trick.

Once you're back, here are some more suggestions:

1. Draw pictures and diagrams. It'll give you another perspective on the problem, and to force you think through the logic of what you're trying to do. Get the problem out of your head.
2. Google & Stack Overflow - paste your errors into Google - the answer may pop right-up, or least give you some ideas on how to proceed.
3. Reach out for help. Ask some of the developers at work for help, use forums in the course, try Slack too.
4. Keep going! Try to make a little progress each day.


Keep moving forward.

Best,
Gary

## My Goals

It's been a long journey from semiconductor field engineer, to electricity sales (yes, there is such a thing), to operations analyst, to IT Business Analyst. I've been interested in becoming a developer for a few years. I even created the Business Analyst role for myself at my current company with the goal of using that experience to transition into a developer role.

As I learn more about how software is developed and deployed, I continue refining the type of developer I want to be. While I enjoy working for my current company, we're a .NET shop, and Houston is a .NET town. And after spending time learning a bit of Python and seeing what an elegant, productive language it is, I'd rather get better with Python than learning more C#. So, unless I want to freelance or move to Austin (which isn't off the table), working as a Python developer isn't a strong option in the short term.

However, what I see at my company is a shortage of front-end expertise. We do have some, but it's spread thin. So here's the latest revision of my short, medium, and long term career goals:

1. Become a front-end developer at my current company
  * Create and build a portfolio of projects I can show, and impress people here enough to become a junior-ish front-end developer.
  * One of the projects might include a re-factor of a few pages of an application I developed the specs for. 
  * Demonstrate enough technical proficiency with HTML, CSS, and Javascript so my manger is comfortable letting me work as a front-end developer
2. Develop enough Python proficiency to pick-up some full-stack projects on the side; aided by my front-end experience.
3. Look for a full-stack Python position somewhere in Texas.
4. Create a business that can generate a stream of income.


## Questions about the process of becoming a Front End Developer. Is there anything about being a Front-End Developer that you’d like to know more about?
* My background is more technical (BSEE, MBA) than creative and graphic design. How does that limit my prospects as a front-end developer?
* Our current Director of Creative Services (i.e. the HTML & CSS subject matter expert) doesn't report to IT, so requests for his assistance with refining the user-experience of IT project get prioritized against his other responsibilities to the organization (including our parent company), leading to significant delays. Our five .NET developers are all full-stack, but two of them are much better with back-end stuff. They know the basics of front-end design, but they're limited in their ability to really "polish" the presentation layer. How can I bolster my case for adding a dedicated resource for front-end work to our group?
* I work for a company where application development supports the business - it's the business itself. How is the front-end developer's job different in a software company versus other types of companies (like mine)?
* I'd love to hear any tips or stories you have about starting out as a front-end developer
