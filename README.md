# Project P0 - Developing a Web Developer Mindset

Imagine that you are a month into your Nanodegree program and you’re stuck. Totally stuck. You have no idea what’s wrong and you have no idea how to get yourself out of this mess. You’ll write a letter to yourself using what you’ve learned. How will you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you tackle challenges? How will what you’ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?

Dear Gary,

So you're having some trouble with your current assignment? You knew it wasn't going to be easy. The Udacity people told you it wasn't going to easy. Remember those articles they had you read at the beginning of the course? Okay, what to do...

First, get your mind right. Recall the "growth mindset" from Joyce Alkiko's "How To Navigate The Up And Downs Of Learning To Code". What can you take away from this challenge so you can get better? Don't worry about how far along, or how much better other developers are; they had to go through something like this too.

Next, take a break! Go take a walk, or go listen to some music for 20 minutes. Seeing the problem with fresh eyes might do the trick.

Once you're back here are some more suggestions:
1) Draw pictures and diagrams. It'll give you another perspective on the problem, and to force you think through the logic of what your trying to do. Get the problem out of your head.
2) Google & Stack Overflow - paste your errors into google - the answer may pop right-up, or least give you some ideas on how to proceed.
3) Reach out for help. Ask some of the developers at work for help, use forums in the course, try Slack too.
4) Keep going! Try to make a little progress each day.

Remember Cameron's quote, "you aren't wrong, you just right yet."

Keep moving forward.

Best,
Gary


Optional: Consider writing your letter using basic markdown syntax, a key skill that front-end developers use to write readmes.

Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals. Is there a dream job you’re working toward? Is there a project idea you’ve been aching to start working on?
Optional: In addition to your goals, we also want to know about any questions you have about the process of becoming a Front End Developer. Is there anything about being a Front-End Developer that you’d like to know more about?
Your reflection project will be reviewed by our Udacity project reviewers, who are all working developers. They are real humans who have faced the same challenges you will, so they’ll be able to offer up some insights that may help you as you embark on these goals! Make sure to take some time to really think about these reflections. Many of these developers have had the same questions and concerns as you, and they want to hear what you have to say!
